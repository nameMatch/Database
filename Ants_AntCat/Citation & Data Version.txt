Note: A name with ACCEPTED_ID = 0 means that the name is an unresolved name. If it has a value or code in the column ACCEPTED_ID_extended, which means that its species-level name is an accepted name, you may replace the “0” value in the column ACCEPTED_ID with the value or code in the column ACCEPTED_ID_extended if you are interested to standardize the name to its accepted species name.
